/// Curated allow-list of official links from verified teams, used to decide how a
/// subscription-provided link (`profile-web-page-url` / `support-url`) is opened:
/// a light confirmation for trusted links, or a serious anti-impersonation
/// warning (with a countdown) for everything else.
///
/// Why: scammers publish look-alike channels/sites (e.g. `t.me/Hiddiify` vs the
/// real `t.me/hiddify`) inside fake subscriptions to steal donations. Only links
/// that exactly match an entry here are treated as trusted.
///
/// The list is managed by the project manager. It is static for now and may
/// later be fetched from GitHub. There is no public "add my link" request flow.
///
/// Matching is EXACT (full URL). Entries and the tapped url are normalized the
/// same way before comparison (see [_normalize]):
/// - the scheme is ignored (http/https treated the same),
/// - the host is lowercased and a leading `www.` is stripped,
/// - a trailing `/` and any `#fragment` are removed,
/// - the path and query are compared exactly (case-sensitive).
///
/// So `t.me/hiddify` matches `https://t.me/hiddify/` and `https://www.t.me/hiddify`,
/// but NOT `t.me/hiddify/123`, `t.me/hiddify?x=1`, or the look-alike `t.me/Hiddiify`.
